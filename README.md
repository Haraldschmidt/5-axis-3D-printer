# 5-axis-3D-printer
I am a master student from Germany working on 5 axis 3D printing in my thesis.
Therefore we have an optimized Prusa i3 MK3 Printer in our 3D lab. This one has an moveable panel to print with 5 axis.  
Our problem is the software, so there is no slicer software which can automatically generate G codes (simultaneous code) for our request.

I am searching for developers which can help me creating an slicer for this 5 axis 3D printing request.
In our 3D lab we have the opportunity to test and verify possible improvements.

Therefore I hope to arouse a great deal of interest for such kind of project.
If there are questions or comments please feel free to contact me (scha1014@hs-karlsruhe.de)

Best regards from Germany,
Harald
